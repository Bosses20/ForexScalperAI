```

## Data Protection and Privacy

### GDPR Compliance (European Union)

If collecting data from EU residents, implement these measures:

1. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only necessary data for trading functions
   - Implement automatic data deletion for unused data

2. **Privacy Notices**:
   - Clear disclosure of data collection and usage
   - User rights regarding data access and deletion

3. **Technical Measures**:
   ```python
   # Example GDPR compliance for data retention
   def purge_expired_user_data():
       """GDPR-compliant data removal for inactive users"""
       retention_days = config["gdpr"]["retention_period_days"]
       cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=retention_days)
       
       # Find inactive users
       inactive_users = database.query(
           "SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE last_activity < %s AND gdpr_delete_requested = TRUE",
           (cutoff_date,)
       )
       
       for user in inactive_users:
           # Anonymize user data
           database.execute(
               "UPDATE users SET name = 'Anonymized', email = NULL, phone = NULL WHERE user_id = %s",
               (user.user_id,)
           )
           
           # Delete detailed history but keep anonymized trading stats for system performance analysis
           database.execute(
               "DELETE FROM detailed_user_activity WHERE user_id = %s",
               (user.user_id,)
           )
           
           logging.info(f"GDPR data purge completed for user {user.user_id}")
   ```

### CCPA Compliance (California)

For users in California, implement:

1. **Right to Delete**:
   - Mechanism for users to request data deletion
   - Verification process for deletion requests

2. **Right to Know**:
   - Clear disclosure of data categories collected
   - Process for users to request their data

3. **Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Example CCPA data access request handler
   def handle_ccpa_data_request(user_id, request_type):
       """Process CCPA data requests (access or deletion)"""
       # Verify user identity
       if not verify_user_identity(user_id):
           return {"status": "error", "message": "Identity verification failed"}
           
       if request_type == "access":
           # Collect all user data
           user_data = gather_all_user_data(user_id)
           return {"status": "success", "data": user_data}
           
       elif request_type == "delete":
           # Process deletion
           delete_user_data(user_id)
           return {"status": "success", "message": "User data deleted per CCPA requirements"}
   ```

## Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

### AML Policy Implementation

1. **Customer Due Diligence**:
   - Risk-based assessment of users
   - Identity verification procedures

2. **Suspicious Activity Monitoring**:
   - Automated detection of unusual patterns
   - Process for reporting suspicious activities

3. **Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Example AML monitoring
   def check_transaction_patterns(user_id):
       """Monitor for suspicious trading patterns"""
       # Get recent user activity
       recent_activity = database.query(
           "SELECT * FROM trades WHERE user_id = %s AND trade_time > %s",
           (user_id, datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30))
       )
       
       # Check for suspicious patterns
       if detect_unusual_timing(recent_activity):
           flag_for_review(user_id, "Unusual trading times")
           
       if detect_round_trip_transactions(recent_activity):
           flag_for_review(user_id, "Potential round-trip transactions")
           
       if detect_structuring(recent_activity):
           flag_for_review(user_id, "Potential structuring activity")
   ```

### Transaction Monitoring

Configure the system to detect and report:

1. **Unusual Trading Patterns**:
   - High-volume trading in dormant accounts
   - Consistent loss-making transactions
   - Trading patterns inconsistent with user profile

2. **Structured Transactions**:
   - Multiple smaller transactions instead of single large ones
   - Consistent transactions just below reporting thresholds

## Record Keeping

### Regulatory Record Retention

1. **Trade Records**:
   - Maintain complete trade history for required periods (typically 5-7 years)
   - Include all order details, modifications, and executions

2. **Audit Trails**:
   - Log all system access and activities
   - Maintain algorithm modification history

3. **Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Example audit logging function
   def audit_log(user_id, action, details, ip_address):
       """Create tamper-evident audit log entry"""
       timestamp = datetime.now()
       log_entry = {
           "user_id": user_id,
           "action": action,
           "details": details,
           "ip_address": ip_address,
           "timestamp": timestamp
       }
       
       # Create hash of the log entry for tamper evidence
       entry_string = f"{timestamp}|{user_id}|{action}|{details}|{ip_address}"
       entry_hash = hashlib.sha256(entry_string.encode()).hexdigest()
       log_entry["entry_hash"] = entry_hash
       
       # Store log entry
       database.insert_audit_log(log_entry)
       
       # If this is a critical action, also write to secure storage
       if action in CRITICAL_ACTIONS:
           write_to_secure_storage(log_entry)
   ```

### Record Export Capabilities

Ensure the system can export records in formats required by regulators:

1. **Export Formats**:
   - CSV/Excel for standard reporting
   - XML/JSON for automated submissions

2. **Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Example record export function
   def export_regulatory_reports(start_date, end_date, format="csv"):
       """Generate regulatory reports for specified time period"""
       # Get all trading activity in the period
       trades = database.query(
           "SELECT * FROM trades WHERE trade_time BETWEEN %s AND %s",
           (start_date, end_date)
       )
       
       if format == "csv":
           return generate_csv_report(trades)
       elif format == "xml":
           return generate_xml_report(trades)
       elif format == "json":
           return generate_json_report(trades)
   ```

## System Controls and Security

### Market Protection Controls

1. **Circuit Breakers**:
   - Stop trading during extreme market conditions
   - Pause after consecutive losses

2. **Order Controls**:
   - Maximum order size limits
   - Price deviation checks

3. **Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Example circuit breaker implementation
   def check_circuit_breakers():
       """Implement regulatory circuit breakers"""
       # Check for extreme market volatility
       for symbol in monitored_symbols:
           current_volatility = calculate_volatility(symbol)
           if current_volatility > config["circuit_breakers"]["max_volatility"]:
               pause_trading(symbol, f"Excessive volatility: {current_volatility:.2f}%")
               
       # Check for consecutive losses
       consecutive_losses = get_consecutive_losses()
       if consecutive_losses >= config["circuit_breakers"]["max_consecutive_losses"]:
           pause_all_trading(f"Safety stop: {consecutive_losses} consecutive losses")
   ```

### Access Controls

1. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Define roles with specific permissions
   - Principle of least privilege

2. **Authentication**:
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - IP restrictions

3. **Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Example role-based access control
   def check_permission(user_id, action):
       """Verify user has permission for the requested action"""
       user_role = get_user_role(user_id)
       
       # Get permissions for this role
       role_permissions = config["access_control"]["roles"][user_role]
       
       if action in role_permissions:
           # Log the access attempt
           audit_log(user_id, "permission_check", f"Granted: {action}", get_client_ip())
           return True
       else:
           # Log the denied access
           audit_log(user_id, "permission_check", f"Denied: {action}", get_client_ip())
           return False
   ```

## Compliance Implementation

       """Check if regulatory configuration needs updates"""
       current_config_hash = get_config_hash("config/compliance_config.yaml")
       last_update_check = get_last_update_check()
       
       # Check if it's been more than 30 days since last update
       if (datetime.now() - last_update_check).days > 30:
           # Log reminder to review regulatory updates
           logging.warning("Regulatory compliance check recommended: 30+ days since last review")
           
           # Notify administrators
           notify_administrators("Monthly regulatory review reminder")
