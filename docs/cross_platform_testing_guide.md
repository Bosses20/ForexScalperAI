3. Steps to reproduce
4. Expected results
5. Actual results
6. Pass/Fail status
7. Screenshots/videos (if applicable)
8. Notes or observations

## 10. Testing Process

### Pre-Release Testing Workflow
1. Development testing (during feature development)
2. Integration testing (when merging features)
3. Regression testing (before each release)
4. User acceptance testing (with selected users)

## 11. Local Deployment Considerations

Since the bot will be running locally on your phone and laptop (not on a VPS), pay special attention to:

1. **Local Network Communication**: Ensure the app can discover and communicate with the local API server
2. **Battery Optimization**: Test performance with and without battery optimization enabled
3. **Background Processing**: Verify the app continues to function properly when in the background
4. **Device Sleep**: Test behavior when the device enters sleep mode
5. **Multi-device Synchronization**: If using both phone and laptop, verify synchronization works correctly

## 12. Cross-Platform Issue Resolution Guidelines

When encountering platform-specific issues:

1. **Isolate the Issue**: Determine if it's platform-specific or universal
2. **Compare Implementations**: Review platform-specific code differences
3. **Check Platform Documentation**: Consult platform-specific best practices
4. **Progressive Resolution**: Fix critical issues first, then address non-blockers
5. **Verify Fixes**: Re-test on all platforms after implementing fixes

By following this guide, you'll ensure your Forex Trading Bot application functions consistently and reliably across both Android and iOS platforms when deployed locally on your devices.
